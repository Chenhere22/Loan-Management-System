# Loan-Management-System
## Project Objective:
To automate and streamline the loan processing workflow by modernizing the existing Loan Management System to enhance efficiency, reduce manual efforts, and improve customer satisfaction.
## Project Justification:
The current loan processing system is manual and outdated, leading to long processing times, increased human errors, and suboptimal customer experiences. By upgrading to an automated Loan Management System, the company can reduce loan approval times, ensure better compliance with regulations, and improve customer satisfaction.
## Business Problem:
The manual loan application and approval process led to delays, operational inefficiencies, compliance issues, and a high rate of human error. The company was losing potential customers due to long approval times and lacked a robust system to track customer data effectively.
## AS-IS State:
•Forex transactions are handled manually by entering data into spreadsheets.
•Exchange rate data is fetched once a day, leading to inconsistencies in trading activities.
•Reporting is generated manually, requiring several hours of processing.
•There is no integration with external financial systems for real-time currency updates.
## TO-BE State:
• Automated forex management system with integration to live currency exchange feeds.
• Real-time currency conversion and tracking across various global currencies.
• Automated regulatory compliance reporting.
• Integration with the organization’s core financial system for seamless operations.
